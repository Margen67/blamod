Blamod Reborn
=================

This is blamod - a HL2 mod geared towards speedrunning and tricking.

# History

The original Blamod under development in 2013. The goal was to provide experience of older versions of HL2 (aka "Old engine" or "pre-OrangeBox") while retaining all the latest stability fixes of modern version of HL2. Unfortunatly development stopped and project was abandoned for 3 years. 

In 2015 when i learned some speedrunning tricks of latest version HL2 (might be the same as available in Steam today). I was never happy with movement and available mechanics. Eventually old author of the project offered me to take over it's develoment ...

... that's how Blamod was reborn.

# Goals

- **Simplify controlls for speedruning**
- **Add desired features and fix anoying bugs** 
- **Mix tricks from multiple versions of HL2**
- **Make simple to install package** (you will still need to own HL2 on Steam)
- **Introduce new mechanics**

New features are added if they are fun and challenging. Consistency with existing games is not as important, but still considered mostly becuase i just don't want to introduce new bugs into this already buggy game. Boring and excessively easy to perform features are most likely going to be thrown away.

# Future

Unclear. This is still alpha stage ... but it's already more stable than the original game :)
