- add cvars:
    * bla\_nofalldamage (self-explanatory)
    * disable speed loss after long drops
    * infinite suite energy
    * sprint while carrying objects, including objects carried by the gravity gun
    * disable environmental damage (cf. poisonous water in HL2 canals)
    * hide the grenade trail
    * bla\_nonpcs (self-explanatory)
- add secondary fire mode to the RPG that enables/disables rocket tracing
- start grenade timer as soon as it is primed
- prevent objects from being dropped when player is moving too fast
- teleport players back to the spawn or checkpoints after death instead of reloading the entire map
- dynamically spawn entities to indicate timer triggers
- add global timer which carries over the current time across map transitions
- make object gibs solid again so that itemflying on broken crates, etc. is possible
- replace "New Game" dialog with a simple map selector to allow for maps to be loaded dynamically without the need for additional chapterX.cfg files
- add blowback to the ar2 to boost the player in the opposite viewing direction
- don't end the game when leaving alyx behind
